        %h4 How do I install and setup SimplyBetter?
        %p
          Installing SimplyBetter is very quick.
          You first create an account on the SimplyBetter
          website and after successfully registering you
          get access to the SimplyBetter script.
          This script will be added just like a
          Google Analytics script into the header of
          your website before the
          = '</body>'
          tag. That simple.

          need to customize or setup your website around it. You do however have the option
          to further customize the widget and change icons, triggers, add a support form or an FAQ list.
          All options are available in the Dashboard once you sign in.
