    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        SimplyBetter, respects and protects the privacy of visitors to our website, www.simplybetter.io (together with the other websites we own and control, the "SimplyBetter Websites"), and our customers who use our on-demand product ideas and innovation management solution, tools and services offered on the SimplyBetter Websites. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect and use visitors' and customers' information, particularly personal information, as part of the Service. The information SimplyBetter collects and uses is limited to the purpose for which customers engage SimplyBetter and other purposes expressly described in this Policy. Any discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the SimplyBetter Websites, whether or not you are a user of SimplyBetter's on­ demand product ideas and innovation management solution.
    </p>
    <h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
    <p>
        When you register for the Service, we ask for personal information such as your name,, e­mail address, as well as certain related information like your application name.
        SimplyBetter may use the personal information you provide to operate the Service and tailor it to your needs, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact and communicate with you about the Service and your use of the Service, send you marketing materials (subject to your opt­out option), for research purposes, and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        SimplyBetter may also share your personal information with its third­party service providers (such as its credit card processors and hosting partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other services we use to operate the Service and maintain a high quality user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Service does not support "do not track" requests.
    </p>
    <h2>Log Files</h2>
    <p>
        As is true with most websites, SimplyBetter gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol addresses as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. Occasionally, we may connect personal information to information gathered in our log files, as necessary to improve the Service for individual customers. Otherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        A "cookie" is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer's hard drive. The main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify your computer and web browser, and tailor web pages and/or login information to your preferences. Cookies help us promptly display the information you need to use the capabilities of the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to you. By gathering and remembering information about your website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and
        marketing experience. Cookies don't give us access to users' computers, and the information we collect through cookies doesn't include personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you use the Service we utilize "session cookies," which allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions. Session cookies disappear from your computer when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. We also utilize "persistent cookies" to identify you as an SimplyBetter customer, agent or end user and make it easier for you to log into and use the Service. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your web browser or turn off your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also use third parties to collect information that assists us in other methods of "remarketing" our Service to visitors to the SimplyBetter Websites, including customized email communications.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can generally accept or decline the use of cookies through functionality built into your web browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.
    </p>

    <h2>Security of Data</h2>
    <p>
        We take the security of data seriously. We practice a risk management strategy and follow industry standard practices including:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Our servers are firewalled and require encrypted logins to access</li>
        <li>Servers and software is regularly updated to latest versions to fix security vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>High risk vulnerabilities are patched as soon as identified and the patch is available</li>
        <li>Any passwords we collect are stored encrypted and salted</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, no security measure is completely effective and SimplyBetter cannot guarantee the complete security of users' personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Change of Ownership or other Business Transaction</h2>
    <p>
        In the event SimplyBetter enters into a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or the sale of all or part of its assets (a “Business Transition”), users’ data (including personally identifiable information and non­personally identifiable information associated with the SimplyBetter services) will likely be part of the assets transferred.
    </p>
    <p>In this event, we will notify you of any Business Transition. We will also notify you of any subsequent material changes to this Privacy Policy as a result of a Business Transaction and give you the opportunity to opt­out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>SimplyBetter reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time consistent with applicable privacy laws. When we do change it, we will make a copy of the updated Privacy Policy available to you before it takes effect. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will also notify you by e­mail. In the event of material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you the opportunity to opt­out for information that we have collected before, or may collect after, a new Privacy Policy containing material changes takes effect.</p>
    <p>You understand and agree that if you use the SimplyBetter services after the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy, SimplyBetter will consider your use as acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
